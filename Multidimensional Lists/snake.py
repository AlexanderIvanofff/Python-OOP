# You will be given an integer n for the size of the snake territory with square shape. On the next n lines, you will
# receive the rows of the territory. The snake will be placed on a random position, marked with the letter 'S'.
# On random positions there will be food, marked with '*'. There might also be a lair on the territory. The lair has two burrows.
# They are marked with the letter - 'B'. All of the empty positions will be marked with '-'.
# Each turn, you will be given command for the snakeâ€™s movement. When the snake moves it leaves a trail marked with '.'
# Move commands will be: "up", "down", "left", "right".
# If the snake moves to a food, it eats the food and increases the food quantity with one.
# If it goes inside of a burrow, it goes out on the position of the other burrow and then both burrows disappear.
# If the snake goes out of its territory, it loses, can't return back and the program ends. The snake needs at least 10 food quantity to win.
# When the snake has gone outside of its territory or has eaten enough food, the game ends.
